# Atos Pattern Matching Algorithm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ucl-team-8/service.svg?branch=CI)](https://travis-ci.org/ucl-team-8/service)

To get started, you will need to install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), [git](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-git-744723531.html), [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) (and [brew](http://brew.sh/), if you're using a mac).

## Setting Up the Database

Create a postgres database with `psql` (installed with PostgreSQL):

```
CREATE USER atos WITH PASSWORD 'atos';
CREATE DATABASE atos WITH OWNER atos;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE atos TO atos;
```

## Setting Up a Local Environment

First, you will need to install `virtualenv` using pip:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

After you have virtualenv installed, create a virtual environment:

```
virtualenv venv
```

In your new virtual environment, clone the repository and cd into the correct repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ucl-team-8/service.git service
cd service
```

Then run these bash commands to set the environment variables in your virtual environment `activate` file:

```
echo "export APP_SETTINGS='config.DevelopmentConfig'" >> venv/bin/activate
echo "export DATABASE_URL='postgres://atos:atos@localhost/atos'" >> venv/bin/activate
```

Activate your virtual environment by running:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Finally, install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing Visualisation Dependencies

To install `node` and `npm` on a Mac, run:

```
brew install node
```

If you don't have brew, see installation instructions [here](http://brew.sh/).

To install `node` and `npm` on Windows, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

After you have `npm`, run:

```
npm install -g jspm
npm install
jspm install
```

Finally, a local environment should be set up.

## Creating the Database Tables

We use `Flask-Migrate` to handle database migrations. To create the necessary database tables, run:

```
python manage.py db upgrade
```

### Importing Data

You will first need to get a copy of the `locations.tsv` file with all of the TIPLOC locations. This file is not publicly available since it is considered confidential information.

To import all of the data in the `data` directory, either run:

```
python import/import.py northern_rail
```

or:

```
python import/import.py east_coast
```

depending on which data set you would like to import.

### Folder Structure

The folder structure of the project is relatively straightforward.
